# Python Virtual Environments



Virtual environments allow us to isolate our python projects by keeping their dependencies separate.  [This](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) is a great article that explains some of the fundamentals and motiviations to use virtual environments.



There are many tools for working with virtual environments.  I won't tell you which one you must use, but you must use one of them.  The options include (from simple to complex):

- [python3 venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (extends the above but with a nicer interface)
- [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html)



I will be using the first one, which comes built in with python.  The most important things you'll need to know when working with virtual environments is

1. How to create a new virtual environment
2. How to activate a virtual environment
3. How to deactivate a virtual environment



The links above discuss installation and and creation/activation of virtual environments.
